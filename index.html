          I am a Data Engineer and Developer, currently working for KPMG's consulting practice.
          I am hungry for the knowledge found in new projects, and the thrill of problem solving.

            During the summer of 2021 I participated in Clarkson's High Performance Computing REU. I developed an implementation of a novel image inpainting algorithm originally proposed by Criminis et al. (2004). We then examined the performance of this algorithm on Electron Backscatter Difraction Data with large missing regions. You can find my implementation of the original Criminisi Algorithm on <a href = "https://github.com/mgw6/criminisi_inpainter">GitHub</a>.

          <h3>Mathematics Senior Capstone</h3>
          <p>
            I spent two semesters analyzing a simple planar discrete dynamical system to better understand how a system with a set of non-isolated equilibrium points of measure one will behave. 
            Code was written in Python using Numpy, and parallelized it using the joblib package.

            I analyzed how an MLB umpire would perform in their next game behind the plate based on their performance in the previous game. 
            I did not find enough evidence to prove that there was a correlation between the two.

          <h3>St. John Fisher College</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bachelor of Science Cum Laude, 2018 - 2022 </li>
            <li>Double Major Mathematics and Economics, Minor in Computer Science</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            During my time at college I was very busy as a Resident Assistant, Executive Intern in the Advancement Office, and Student Ambassador.
            One of the highlights of my week, was playing guitar at the 7:30 PM mass on Sundays. We had a great time and mass was frequently attended by over 100 students. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Fisher had a very tight-knit community, and classes were rarely over 15 students. This individual instruction really allowed me to grow and find myself as a student.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of my favorite professors at Fisher was Dr. Muench, who graduated from Fisher in 1955 - the first graduating class! He returned to the school in 1966 and taught there until his retirement after the spring 2022 semester. Dr. Muench had so many great stories to tell about the college and his time as a professor. During the spring 2021 - 2022 academic year, the college was preparing to transition to University status. While Dr. Muench's retirement had nothing to do with this change, I like to think that St. John Fisher college just could not go on without Dr. Muench, and so the school had to change its name.

            <li>Mathematics and Economics</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After my internship for the summer of 2020 was canceled due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, I enrolled in summer classes at Stony Brook University, The University at Buffalo, and Monroe County Community College. These were all great experiences because they opened my eyes to new horizons while reminding me why I loved Fisher so much. Because these were larger institutions than what I was used to I was surrounded by so many brilliant people that pushed me to be better every day.
